# Banking-ETL
An extract, transform and load pipeline programmed in Python which processes banking data. There are two kinds of tables which are extracted: user information and branch information. The user tables are extracted from bank.csv and bank.xlsx, and contain the tables SSN, First Name, Last Name, Branch and Balance. The branch table is extracted from branch.xlsx and contains the tables Branch, Address and Number of Members. The data is extracted from the files into pandas dataframes. Then, various transformations are performed on the tables in order to clean and enhance the data. Finally, the finished data is loaded onto the csv file transformed.csv.
